## Description:
  YourAnimeSucks aims to answer two questions: does the quality of anime correlate with popularity and as the name of the website suggests, does your anime taste suck? Our website uses scraped data from the website MyAnimeList, a website that allows users to keep track of the anime they have seen and rank them out of ten. We will be using the popularity and the average rating to determine a possible correlation. The other key feature is our search system that will allow users to generate bar graphs and pie charts that show the number/percentage of anime in a specified category (Ex. A pie chart that breaks down the 1000 most popular anime on MAL by genre). Alternatively, users can use the search feature to search their ideal anime and find the average popularity and rating based on the anime that fulfill the criteria to see if their taste in anime sucks or not.
